<h1>Learning Experience Design (LXD) — Complete Job-Ready Guide</h1>
<p>Everything you need to know to land your first LXD role — on one page.</p>

<main>
<section>
  <h2>Role Snapshot — What LXD Is (and Isn’t)</h2>
  <p><strong>Learning Experience Designers</strong> use learning science and UX methods to close real performance gaps. You analyze the task, define what “good” looks like, design the learning path and performance supports, build the assets, and prove impact with data.</p>
  <div>
    <h3>Day to Day</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Meet stakeholders and subject matter experts (SMEs) to define the problem and KPIs.</li>
      <li>Write performance based objectives and align assessments and activities to them.</li>
      <li>Prototype modules, branching scenarios, and job aids; test with learners.</li>
      <li>Ship to an LMS; track completion and outcomes; report insights and iterate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Success Measures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Faster time to competence, fewer errors, higher QA or CSAT, higher adoption of a process.</li>
      <li>Evidence comes from pre vs post, scenario performance, on the job metrics, and surveys.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Hiring lens:</strong> Entry level candidates win by showing outcome alignment, accessibility basics, and simple metrics. Tool lists alone do not get interviews.</p>

  <h2>Competency Map — What To Learn (and How To Show It)</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <h3>Analysis and Alignment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rapid needs analysis: stakeholder interview, learner interview, task walk through.</li>
        <li>Problem statement: who, what task, current vs desired performance, KPI.</li>
        <li>Objectives with Bloom verbs at the apply or analyze level.</li>
        <li>Backward design: Objectives ↔ Evidence ↔ Activities kept in lockstep.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Development and Delivery</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One authored module with checks and feedback (Rise or H5P or Storyline).</li>
        <li>One branching scenario with at least three decision points and remediation.</li>
        <li>One job aid for the moment of need, tested for usability.</li>
        <li>Package SCORM, upload to an LMS, verify tracking, and record results.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <h2>Learning Science — What Actually Improves Performance</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <h3>Core Models</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ADDIE</strong> for structure; <strong>SAM</strong> for fast iteration; <strong>Backward Design</strong> for alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Gagne’s 9 Events</strong> for lesson flow; <strong>ARCS</strong> to motivate.</li>
        <li><strong>UDL</strong> to design for variability from the start.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mechanics That Work</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Retrieval practice beats rereading; use short checks and scenario prompts.</li>
        <li>Spaced repetition schedule example: Day 0, Day 2, Day 5, Day 12 follow ups.</li>
        <li>Cognitive load: remove decorative noise, chunk steps, use worked examples.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Assessment and Evidence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Criterion referenced checks: pass means the learner can perform the task.</li>
        <li>Preferred evidence: time to competence, error rate, QA pass rate, CSAT.</li>
        <li>Make a tiny A B or pre post and show the chart in your case study.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Tip:</strong> If your portfolio shows one realistic metric improving, you stand out.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Accessibility — WCAG AA Essentials You Must Practice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Color contrast at least 4 point 5 to 1 for normal text; do not use color alone for meaning.</li>
    <li>Headings in order, logical reading order, visible focus states.</li>
    <li>All images have purposeful alt text; charts include data summaries.</li>
    <li>Provide captions and transcripts; avoid auto play audio; keyboard navigation works.</li>
    <li>Readable copy: short sentences, plain language, generous spacing and font size.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Alt Text Formula</h3>
  <p>Describe the essential information that a sighted learner would need to complete the task. Skip purely decorative details.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Authoring and Media — Step by Step</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <h3>Module (Rise or H5P)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Draft objectives and checks first. Outline sections to match the checks.</li>
        <li>Build short blocks: example, guided practice, quick check with feedback.</li>
        <li>Add captions, alt text, and keyboard focus order. Test on mobile.</li>
        <li>Export SCORM; set completion on quiz pass or by progress plus quiz.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Branching Scenario (Storyline or H5P Branching)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Map 3 to 5 decisions; write realistic options with consequences.</li>
        <li>Write feedback that explains the why and links back to objectives.</li>
        <li>Track a simple score and show a final summary with remediation tips.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Media Standards</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Audio: aim for clear noise free voice, target around minus 16 LUFS for stereo exports.</li>
        <li>Video: keep micro videos under 5 minutes, 1080p, include on screen cues and captions.</li>
        <li>Writing: front load key points, use numbered steps, label buttons exactly as they appear.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>SCORM and xAPI Basics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>SCORM records completion, score, and time. Set a pass threshold and attempt limit.</li>
        <li>xAPI sends flexible statements like actor verb object to a learning record store.</li>
        <li>For entry level, show SCORM proficiency and basic xAPI awareness.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>LMS — What You Need To Operate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a course shell, set enrollment, due dates, and completion rules.</li>
    <li>Upload SCORM package, test with a learner account, confirm gradebook mapping.</li>
    <li>Verify resume behavior, bookmarking, and pass or fail reporting.</li>
    <li>Export basic reports and include one screenshot in your case study.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Data and Evaluation — From Kirkpatrick to ROI</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Level 1 reaction: helpful but not sufficient. Keep it short.</li>
    <li>Level 2 learning: use a post check aligned to objectives; prefer scenario performance.</li>
    <li>Level 3 behavior: supervisor rubric or system data that shows change on the job.</li>
    <li>Level 4 results: a business KPI such as fewer errors or faster cycle time.</li>
    <li>Simple analysis: show baseline vs post and a short narrative on what likely caused the change.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Project Management and Collaboration</h2>
  <div class="grid">
    <div>
      <h3>With Stakeholders and SMEs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Kickoff: define problem, audience, KPI, constraints, timeline, review cadence.</li>
        <li>SME interview prompts: common errors, high value tasks, critical steps, edge cases.</li>
        <li>RACI: who approves, who contributes, who is informed.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Workflow</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Artifacts per round: outline, script and storyboard, prototype, pilot, release.</li>
        <li>Version control: name files with project name, artifact, version, date.</li>
        <li>Change log: document decisions and rationales to reduce rework.</li>
      </ul>

Example: De escalate an angry caller within 2 minutes using the 3 step model and log the case correctly.
      </pre>
      <h3>Microcopy Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the exact UI labels learners will see on the job.</li>
        <li>Write feedback that teaches: what happened, why it matters, what to do next.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Scenario Writing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start from real incidents or tickets; change details to anonymize.</li>
        <li>Each decision should test the target objective at least once.</li>
        <li>Include at least one attractive wrong option that reveals a common misconception.</li>
